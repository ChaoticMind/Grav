IE9:
Bug: When a body goes beyond 2000000 in the positive or negative x direction, or past 2000000 in the negative y direction, it will disappear. If a body goes past 2000000 in the positive y direction, it will only move horizontally in that direction, with possible duplicate bodies being rendered. Bodies will be rendered normally when they cross back from the limits.
Source: Must be an issue with IE's implementation of Canvas, problem not found in other browsers.

Bug (this one also applies to Firefox): When trace is turned on, on higher trace lengths residues are left over by the traces instead of being completely erased.
Source: Issue with IE's and Firefox's implementations of Canvas, problem not found in other browsers.

Chrome:
Bug (this one also applies to Safari): When trace is turned on, Chrome will not keep the trace if view box is moved. It may draw distorted copies of the current view elsewhere on the canvas. 
Source: Must be an issue with Webkit's implementation of Canvas, method used to preserve trace draws canvas to a hidden canvas before transformations to view box are applied. The canvas copy is rendered in the canvas's dimensions (1200x600) in the other browsers, but it is rendered differently in Chrome.

Bug: If zoomed out far enough, no bodies will be visible. Bodies are visible again after zooming back in.
Source: Must be an issue with Chrome's implementation of Canvas, zooming out does nothing in the other browsers.
